     content: `The end of the year has seen significant further changes inside 
     the refugee camp where Lesvos refugees live. The best of all are that, 
     after so many years of hygienic issues and he stay in tents, finally new 
     containers with toilets and hot water showers connected to the municipal 
     water supply were put in place across numerous sites in the camp. Also, 
     all those residents who were living in tents have been moved into improved 
     Refugee Housing Units (RHUs) over the past few weeks. This move did not 
     prevent many individuals living in tents during extremely cold weather of 
     the beginning and middle of December.`,
